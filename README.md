# Syldeyn

Syldeyn is a quick tool that updates the license blocks in my source code and also keep their version numbers up-to-date.
It replaces my old MKL_Update tool. 

## Purpose

I wrote Syldeyn only to make my own life easier, but if you have a use for it, by all means, use Syldeyn as you see fit.
Syldeyn has a GPL3 license, it has been designed to be used in both Windows and Linux.

## Name

Aside from a code I am also a fantasy novellist. My main series is the Phantasar Chronicles. A spinoff series named "Slyvina" (the name giver of the Slyvina framework as a whole), has a recurring character named "Syldeyn". 
A colonel in the army with which Slyvina often has to cooperate, so Syldeyn and Slyvina know each other quite well.


## Work

Syldeyn works quite easily, just start it from the directory you wish Syldeyn to manage, and Syldeyn will ask you everything it needs to know, and store your answers, so it doesn't have to ask again.
Syldeyn will automatically add a license block to source files and update their version numbers "Ubuntu style", so last to digits of the current year dot month dot day. Quite easy, actually.
